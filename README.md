# Python-Pascals-Triangles
Generates (and filters) Pascal's triangles just for you.
Requires Python 2.7.

If you want to find out how to use the code without the I/O access, look into main.py. It's only 32 lines, 
which are 50% String and ~12% empty lines. the rest should be quite easily understandable code, even for beginners.
If you need help with anything regarding this repo, feel free to contact me via github or open an issue.

Have Fun!
