# Python-Pascals-Triangles
Generates (and filters) Pascal's triangles just for you.
Requires Python 2.7.

If you want to find out how to use the code without the I/O access, look into main.py. It's only 32 lines, 
which are 50% String and ~12% empty lines. the rest should be quite easily understanfdable code, even for beginners.
Have Fun!
